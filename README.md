# LBWeather
An application for obtaining weather data in a certain area.

The application is responsible for displaying the current weather and weather data for the whole day and the forecast for the next 3 days.
This screen also has a slide-out panel that we can use to search for the desired location. From this panel, clicking on the locations menu takes us to a second screen that lists the locations we've added over time, they're always saved until the user deletes them, but we always have one location that can't be deleted. Ability to add location based on user's current location. Internet Connection Listener
